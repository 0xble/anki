# Custom Add-ons

This folder stores custom Anki add-ons tracked in the `~/Repos/anki` fork.
Workspace path: `~/Repos/anki/addons/`

Runtime load path remains:
`~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/`

Use symlinks from the runtime add-ons directory to folders in this repo
for custom add-ons.
Keep AnkiWeb-managed add-ons (typically numeric IDs) in the runtime
directory unless explicitly migrated.
